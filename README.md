Chapters & Why They Matter

0:00:00 — Cold reboot; why Substack isn’t “social” yet
Failed first go-live; quick reset; diagnosis: Substack’s stack behaves like a newsletter tool, not a social platform; gaps in live reliability, analytics, and discovery limit creator growth; takeaway: brand buys time, engineering debt burns it.

0:03:00 — IRL origins → why people watch
Royce’s Disney IRL phase; post-pandemic “presence” and ambient companionship drive early traction; takeaway: IRL value started as low-stakes escapism, not shock.

0:05:30 — When incentives bend reality
Parasocial spillover (“take us everywhere”), creators escalating for clips, a street-fight anecdote to show clout dynamics; takeaway: IRL’s center of gravity tilts toward spectacle once algorithms reward spikes over substance.
